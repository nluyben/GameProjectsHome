  <h3> The Legend of Zelda Dungeon 1 Remastered</h3>
    <p>
      This project is a remastered version of the original "The Legend of Zelda" game (1986), created using Unity. This project is a challenge to gain understanding in Unity and game design principles.
      We did introduce a twist, however, as our verison includes a secret level with a new weapon. Play to discover what it is (press 4).

  <h4> My Contributions:</h4>
    <p> This project was a partner project between Akshey Deokule and myself. Akshey focused primarily on the player movement,
      weapons, health system, visuals, and half of the enemies. I primarily focused on map navigation and construction, collectibles,
      cheats, audio, and the other half of the enemies. Specifically, I created:
    </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Collectible Power-ups: rupees, restoration hearts, bombs, keys </li>
  <li>Inventory: system for keeping track of all picked up items </li>
  <li>Room Navigation: transitions between rooms, doors, locking mechanisms (key, enemy, and block based), toggling enemy activity on entering and exiting rooms</li>
  <li>Movement: mechanics governing how player and enemies, walls, water, projectiles will be moved</li>
  <li>Gel: enemy that moves in  a grid-like fashion, hopping to adjacent tiles in a discrete manner</li>
  <li>Wallmaster: enemy that emerges from walls and has the ability to drag you back to the start of the level</li>
  <li>Map Features: implemented water tiles, pushable blocks, and 2D Bow Room</li>
  <li>Ice Gun Features: implemented freezing mechanics on water, blaze obstacles and extinguishing mechanics, enemy freezing</li> 
  <li>Authentic progression: Testing to ensure that values, such as enemy count and movement speed, are accurate to the original game</li>
  <li>Audio: implemented audio associated with in-game actions, including hits, kills, pickups, unlocking doors, using weapons, etc</li>
  <li>Custom Level: designed and created the custom level utilizing the ice gun, including new Blaze obstacles and Flame Knight enemy</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Quantum Quickstep</h3>
    <p>
      A competitive top-down 2-player Capture-The-Flag game. Only controllers are supported for this game, not keyboard.
    </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/GameProjectsHome/DeliverablesGold/index.html">Quantum Quickstep</a></li>
</ul>
  <h4> My Contributions:</h4>
    <p> This is a solo project focused on rapid prototyping and was developed over the span of 2 weeks.
      It follows a very traditional CTF design, with a new gimmick. Each player controls 2 separate characters.
      Interact with Quantum gates placed around the map to swap controls and superposition between your two characters.

  <h3> Providence</h3>
    <p>
      A refined 1v1 swordfighting game focused on precise angle-based attacks and parries.
    </p>
 <li><a href="/GameProjectsHome/Webby/index.html">Providence</a></li>
</ul>
  <h4> Summary:</h4>
    <p> This is a skill-based sword fighting game. You must defeat progressively faster and tougher enemies in a series of 1v1 duals, culminating towards a huge final boss.
      The combat system is centered around a precise angle-based sword fighting. You must parry at precise angles to block incoming attacks and the angles for your attacks determine how enemies parry and follow up with their attacks. This was created in Unity with a C# codebase.
    </p>
  <h4> My Contributions:</h4>
    <p> This project was made by a 5-person team:  Akshey Deokule, Alan Lee, Nathaniel Luyben, Justin Smith, and Harry Tong. We often collaborated on various aspects of the project, but we all maintained particular sections of the project as our expertise.
    </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Audio: I implemented all Audio in the game, including combat sound effects, dynamic footsteps based on terrain, music transitions, and environmental sound effects.</li>
  <li>Arena System: I implemented the modular 1v1 arena system that instantiates and configures enemies with their respective movesets. They enclose the player and enemy in a circular arena of rock and track which enemies have been defeated.</li>
  <li>Checkpointing System: I designed and implemented the checkpointing system that resets the player and all unconquered arenas on death. This includes all functionality and aesthetics. </li>  
  <li>CutScenes: I designed and implemented cutscenes for each level, which guide the player through the correct path to beat all enemies.</li>
  <li>EventBus Structure: Our game's codebase operates through a Pub-Sub architecture, which conceptualizes in-game actions as discrete events and functions by distributing published events to subscribers.
    I designed the EventLists that structure our game.</li>
  <li>Camera: I designed and implemented all camera controls and functionality.</li> 
  <li>Movement: I overhauled the movement and player control structure.</li> 
  <li>Dodge: I created the dodge mechanic.</li>
