  <h3> The Legend of Zelda Dungeon 1 Remastered</h3>
    <p>
      This project is a remastered version of the original "The Legend of Zelda" game (1986), created using Unity. This project is a challenge to gain understanding in Unity and game design principles.
      We did introduce a twist, however, as our verison includes a secret level with a new weapon. PLay to discover what it is (press 4).

  <h4> My Contributions:</h4>
    <p> This project was a partner project between Akshey Deokule and Myself. Akshey focused primarily on the player movement,
      weapons, health system, visuals, and half of the enemies. I primarily focused on map navigation and construction, collectibles,
      cheats, audio, and the other half of the enemies. Specifically, I created:
    </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Collectible Power-ups:rupees,restoration hearts, bombs, keys </li>
  <li>Inventory: system for keeping track of all picked up items </li>
  <li>Room Navigation: transitions between rooms, doors, locking mechanisms (key, enemy, and block based), toggling enemy activity on entering and exiting rooms</li>
  <li>Gel: enemy that moves in  a grid-like fashion, hopping to adjacent tiles in a discrete manner</li>
  <li>Wallmaster: enemy that emerges from walls and has the ability to drag oyu back to the start of the level</li>
  <li>Map Features: implemented water tiles and pushable blocks</li>
  <li>Ice Gun Features: implemented freezing mechanics on water, blaze obstacles and extinguishing mechanics, enemy freezing</li> 
  <li>Authentic progression</li>
  </ul>
